# Getting Started
`commoners` allows anyone to build their application for web, desktop, and mobile.

## Build Targets
`commoners` relies on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) to generate the essential frontend files for each build target.

### Web
Web builds are the default build target. These builds are intended to be deployed to a web server, and are accessible from any device with a web browser.

#### PWA
Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are web applications that can be installed on a device and accessed from the home screen. PWAs are supported on most modern browsers, and can be installed on both desktop and mobile devicesâ€”though they will have limited access to native features.

`commoners` relies on [vite-plugin-pwa]() to generate the necessary files for a PWA. To enable this feature, simply add the `--pwa` flag to your build command.

### Desktop
Desktop builds are intended to be installed on a user's computer. These builds are accessible from the desktop, and have access to native features.

`commoners` relies on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org) to generate the necessary files for a desktop application. To enable this feature, simply add the `--desktop` flag to your build command.


### Mobile
Mobile builds are intended to be installed on a user's mobile device. These builds are accessible from the home screen, and have access to native features.

`commoners` relies on [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com) to generate the necessary files for a mobile application. To enable this feature, simply add the `--mobile` flag to your build command.

#### iOS
If you are building for iOS, you will need to install the following dependencies:
- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org)

> **Note:** If your pods are not installed automatically, you may need to update gems (`sudo gem update --system`) and / or reinstall an older version of CocoaPods (`sudo gem install cocoapods:1.10.2`) for the CLI tool to properly initialize your project.

#### Android
If you are building for Android, you will need to install the following dependencies:
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Services
Services are independent processes that the main application depends on. These may be `local` or `remote` based on the distributed application files.

> **Note:** `commoners` currently supports `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.exe`, and `.pkg` services.

To declare a service, you simply add the source file path to the `commoners.config.js` file:
```js
export default {
    services: {
        test: './services/test/index.ts'
    },
}
```

To use a service, you should (1) check for the existence of the service, then (2) instantiate the appropriate URL from the `COMMONERS` global object:

```js
    if ('test' in COMMMONERS.services) {
        const url = new URL(COMMONERS.services.test.url)
        // ....
    }
```

If your service will be accessible from a particular URL, you'll want to make sure that the `port` used is derived from the `PORT` environment variable:

```js
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000
```

### Using Services in Production
Service configurations may be different between development and production. For instance, `.py` services are commonly packaged using `pyinstaller`, which will output an `.exe` / `.pkg` file that includes all dependencies.

The following service structure would be used to handle this case:

> **Note:** The entirety of the `--outDir` (default: `dist`) folder is copied as extra resources to Electron. Include any required assets there.
```json
{
    "src": "src/main.py",
    "publish": {
        "build": {
            "mac": "python -m PyInstaller --name test --onedir --clean ./src/main.py --distpath ./dist/pyinstaller",
        },
        "local": {
            "src": "./dist/pyinstaller/test/test"
        }
    }
}
```

## Plugins
Plugins are collections of JavaScript functions that run at different points during app initialization. These points include:
1. `main` - Immediately on Electron main process instantiation (`desktop` builds only)
2. `preload` - Before the DOM is loaded 
3. `render` - After the DOM is loaded 

> **Note:** Official plugins can be found in the `@commoners` namespace on NPM, and are listed in the [official plugins](/plugins/official) section.

To declare a plugin, you simply add the relevant configuration object in the `plugins` array of the `commoners.config.js` file:
```js
export default {
    plugins: [
        {
            name: 'selective-builds',
            isSupported: {
                desktop: {
                    render: false,
                    preload: false
                },
                mobile: {
                    render: false
                },
                web: {
                    preload: false
                }
            },
            main: () => console.log('desktop build (main)'),
            preload: () => console.log(COMMONERS.TARGET + ' build (preload)'),
            render: () => console.log(COMMONERS.TARGET + ' build (render)'),
        }
    ]
}
```

To use a plugin, you should check for the existence of the plugin, which *may* have a return value separately stored in the `plugins.loaded` and `plugins.rendered` propreties:

```js
    if ('test' in COMMMONERS.plugins.loaded) {
        const loadedPlugin = COMMMONERS.plugins.loaded.test
        const renderedPlugin = COMMMONERS.plugins.loaded.rendered
        // ....
    }
```

For code executed in the `main` function, there are several global variables available to you by default:

- `COMMONERS_PLATFORM` - The current build platform (`mac`, `windows`, `linux`, `ios`, or `android`)
- `COMMONERS_TARGET` - The current build target (`desktop`, `mobile`, or `web`)
- `COMMONERS_MODE` - The current build mode (`development`, `local`, or `remote`)

Additional global variables will be loaded from your `.env` file, if present.
