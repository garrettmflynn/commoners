# Why Commoners?

`commoners` allows anyone to build hybrid applications—distributed on web, desktop, and mobile—without the hassle of additional languages and libraries.

## Competitors
- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) - While React Native is a popular cross-platform solution, it assumes a React-based frontend—limiting its flexibility.
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) - While Flutter is an elegant cross-platform solution, it uses Dart as its primary language—substantially increasing the barrier to entry.
- [Renative](https://renative.org) - While Renative is a promising cross-platform solution, it is still in its infancy—limiting its stability.

## Synergies
