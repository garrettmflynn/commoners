## commoners
Start your project in development mode 

## commoners build

> **Note:** To minimize rebuilding, you must manually specify `--services` to build what you need. For instance, your first `--desktop` should be accompanied by `--services` to build all servicesâ€”though you may omit this until you change your service files.

### Additional Options
- `--pwa` - As a Progressive Web App
- `--desktop --publish [condition]` - Publish a release of your application to GitHub on the provided condition ([`string`](https://www.electron.build/configuration/publish.html#how-to-publish))
    - **Note:** While [other providers](https://www.electron.build/configuration/publish.html#publishers) are possible to use, they have not been tested with this command.

## commoners launch

> **Note:** No service-related options available for this command

## commoners share
Share the application's services
- `--port` - The port to use for the service gateway (`number`)

> **Note:** To be shared, you must internally configure your service to be hosted on `0.0.0.0` rather than `localhost`.
