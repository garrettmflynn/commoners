# Walkthrough Roadmap 
1. How to use the OpenAPI standard to document your services
2. How to setup a local network of services using `commoners share` and `@commoners/local-services`, using the OpenAPI standard to generate UI interactions
    - Since we don't anticipate that all services will be documented using OpenAPI, these steps aren't handled by `commoners` interally
