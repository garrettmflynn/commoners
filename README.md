 The `commoners` CLI **allows anyone to build their application for web, desktop, and mobile** without the fuss of additional languages or libraries (e.g. Dart, React, etc.).

A complete example of a COMMONERS application that connects to peripheral devices using Bluetooth and Serial across multiple platforms is available at our [commoners-starter-kit](https://github.com/garrettmflynn/commoners-starter-kit) repository.

Read the [documentation](https://commoners.dev) to learn more.

## Developer Notes
For testing the CLI, install `packages/core` and `packages/cli` globally.

`commoners` is maintained by Garrett Flynn, who originally developed the tool to streamline development of the [NWB GUIDE](https://github.com/neurodatawithoutborders/nwb-guide) application and support future hybrid application development for [Catalyst Neuro](https://github.com/catalystneuro).
